You will need to implement stubs in the files  "issue.c" and "exec.c"
to support forwarding.

Branch instructions are handled as in the base solution by updating the PC in
the MEM stage. That is, there is no optimization for speculation. You will have
to add NOPs to the programs to handle control dependencies.
However, after you implement the forwarding mechanisms, there should be no
NOPs needed (or allowed) for data dependencies.

The programs do the same functions as before but the instruction order has  been changed to 
stress forwarding. Do not change the programs (besides adding NOPs for branches).


The file "sync.c" has been changed to implement stalls. If you set the "stallIF"
signal to TRUE in issue.c, it will introduce a stall in the next cycle.

1. no NOPs for other operations
2. add NOPs for branches. 
3. modify the issue.c and exec.c
