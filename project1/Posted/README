To compile:

% gcc sim.c fetch.c issue.c exec.c mem.c write.c sync.c utils.c  <PROGRAM FILE> ./yacsim.o -lm -o <OUTPUT FILE> 

<PROGRAM FILE> is one of program1.c, program2.c or program3.c 
<OUTPUT FILE> is whatever you choose to name your executable


global.h contains definitions and constant values
For this assignemnt you will only need to change the constant NUM_ITERATIONS to run the programs for different array sizes


program1.c: Adds together  integers of array1.

program2.c: Performs element-wise addition of two integer arrays array1 and array2 and stores the results in array3.

program3.c: Copies  integers from array1 to array2.


The size of the vectors is changed by the constant NUM_ITERATIONS in "global.h"
The  base addresses of arrays  array1, array2 and array3 are defined by the constants  BASE_ARRAY_SRC1, BASE_ARRAY_SRC2, BASE_ARRAY_DEST respectively in "global.h".
The maximum size of the arrays is 256 integers.
The arrays are initialized as follows:
array1: 500, 501, 502, ...
array2: 756, 757, 758, ... 
array3: 1012, 1013, 1014, ....

The reset() function in utils.c loads the program into instruction memory, initializes the arrays, sets the register values, and clears internal pipeline registers.
