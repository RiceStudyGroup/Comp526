Changes from PART 1:

Stubs for functions to be coded by you have been included in files "fetch.c", "issue.c" and "mem.c"

For  program1.c, program2.c and program3.c use the optimized versions that you wrote in PART 1 as the
workload.

Pipeline registers now have additional fields to convey  branch-related  information from the ISSUE and MEM
stages to the FETCH stage. (See the template in global.h).
